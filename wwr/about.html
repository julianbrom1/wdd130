            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Our Story
                Founded in 2024, our rafting company began with a single vision: to share the thrill of whitewater rafting with adventurers from all walks of life. What started as a passion project among a small group of river enthusiasts quickly transformed into one of the region's premier rafting companies, offering unforgettable experiences on some of the most breathtaking rivers in Colombia.
                
                Our founders were inspired by a deep love for the outdoors and a desire to create something more than just a rafting business. They sought to build a community of adventurers, conservationists, and explorers who understand the transformative power of nature.</p>
